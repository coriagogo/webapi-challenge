    Middleware and Routing

    A resource is the data that an API has that is retrieved/managed with endpoints. Everything is a resource when designing a RESTful Web Api.
    
- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

    HTTP status codes 200 and 201 and messages.

- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

    We can use routing with different routers.
